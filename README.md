### Happy to meet you!

I am a technical support engineer learning front-end development. I like creating pretty things and it makes me very happy.

**What I'm up to?**

- I'm currently working on my 100 days projects
- Trying to get back on track with regular commits and daily programming
- Revising JavaScript, creating responsive css layouts and updating my react knowledge

**What've I been up to this week?**
