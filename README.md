### Happy to meet you!

I am a junior software engineer focusing on front-end development. I like creating pretty things and it makes me very happy.

**What I'm up to?**

- Currently working on some front-end mentor challenges
- Thinking about some personal projects
- Trying to get back on track with regular commits and daily programming


**What've I been up to this week?**
